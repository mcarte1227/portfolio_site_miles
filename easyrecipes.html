        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>Easyrecipes is a responsive web-based application aimed to provide users who are busy throughout the day with a variety of simple recipes to follow that saves on time and ingredients. This way, they can find simple and quick recipes that
          caters to a variety of eating and life styles regardless of the amount of culinary experience they may or may not have. While going on Eaayrecipes, users will be able to search for simple and quick recipes of any category, save them to a
          list, add them to a custom meal planner, and follow along with text or video instructions.</p>

        <p>The following hypothesis statement was then formulated to use as a foundation for my user research.</p>

        <p>"Users with a busy and hectic schedule, new to cooking, or just want short and simple recipes to follow will be able to have a variety of options to choose from."</p>

        <h3>APPROACH</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>After selecting and conducting interviews with a few select individuals for what they would like to see in a recipe app, I constructed the following Minimal Viable Product objective statement and user story quotes to to use as a basis for
          designing my app going forward.</p>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The brief for this project was rather open ended, as it mainly just called for me to design a responsive web application for either a location-based or recipe site.</li>
          <li>I decided on my features based on the types of responses I received from the initial user interview stage. From the frustrations and lack of specific functions given to me by those I interviewed, I did my best to offer a solution to
            solve those issues.</li>
          <li>In terms of design challenges, I remembered hitting a roadblock when it came to the multiple rapid sketching. From the beginning, I already had a general layout idea in my mind I wanted to use, and having to sketch out multiple ideas
            one after the other proved to be quite difficult.</li>
          <li>When I did come up with different layout ideas, I felt as though they were rather sparse and I was not coming up with as many distinct different ideas as I should have been. To combat this, after each set of crazy 8’s, I took a short
            break to try to clear my head. Then, I did manage to come up with a few new layout designs more frequently did I did before.</li>
          <li>Overall, I believe I met the original objective of designing a responsive recipe web application. During the earlier phases of the process, I made sure to consult the responses I received from the interviews regarding what users would
            like to see in a recipe app when planning the layout.</li>
