        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>The 1980’s seem to be a decade fondly remembered by many, with the aesthetic and imagery having been intergraded in pop culture. My music streaming app, 80’s Player, serves to provide a nostalgic experience by featuring music from this
          distinct era, as well as other retro-themed music numerous artists can upload and share.</p>
        <p>The objective for my first project under CareerFoundry was defined as designing an 80’s themed music player app which aligned with established mobile design patterns while having a unique brand identity. Therefore, I would pursue to design
          this app with the intention of providing users with the best streaming experience of the music from the iconic decade from various artists around the globe.</p>
        <div>
        </div>
        <h3>APPROACH</h3>
        <p>When I started the project, I looked into other music apps I was already familiar with (ex. Spotify, Soundcloud, YouTube Music), and studied their layout and design patterns. However, I took the biggest inspiration from Spotify since it’s
          the music streaming app I use the most.</p>

        <h3>INITIAL SKETCHES</h3>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Starting out drawing the designs on paper allowed me to freely get all my ideas out of my head and see which design patterns worked, and which didn’t.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>
        <p>I then moved on to create wireframes in Adobe XD that would serve as the foundation for the eventual completed design based on the initial sketches.</p>

        <div>
        </div>
        <h3>MOOD BOARD</h3>
        <p>When creating the mood board, I was particular about gathering images that matched the exact type of retro, 80’s aesthetic I was drawn to. I ended up drawing inspiration from the use of dark purples, magentas, and glowing, neon colors
          often associated with the “retrowave” look.</p>

        </picture>
        <div>
        </div>
        <h3>STYLE GUIDE</h3>
        <p>After the mood board was complete, I moved on to creating the style sheet that I would apply to the elements of the app.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>

        </div>
        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>The main challenge I faced when going through the process of creating 80’s Player was accurately portraying the overall aesthetic of the 80’s and retrowave into a modern-looking app, as well as coming up with the right features to include.
          Following the color palette I have chosen, while also applying them to elements while having the whole design look unified proved to be difficult for me as well. Because this was my first project under Career Foundry, I initially struggled
          some on deciding the right features to include in my music player app.</p>
        <p>As well as including base functions such as creating an account and saving songs to playlists, I analyzed other popular music streaming apps such as Spotify, Soundcloud and YouTube Music to get a better grasp on what I should include and
          how my app ought to be structured. Analyzing other existing apps and being able to see why certain functions were added is a skill I continued to carry with me throughout the rest of the course.</p>
